This picture depicts the economic cycle for **the whole economy.**

It consists of:

1. **Expansion** - the phase of cycle when most companies grow, economy expands and everything goes smooth.
2. **Business Peak** - the highest point that economy is able to reach in one cycle.
3. **Contraction (Recession)** - the phase of cycle when most companies shrinkg, economy contracts, unmployment rate rises, as well as inflation.
4. **Recessionary Trough (Depression)** - the lowest point that the company reaches in one cycle. After this point the cycles goes all over.

_**During expansion**_ the most interesting companies for us are **The Growth Companies** - the companies that promise high returns in the future.

_**During contraction**_ the most interesting companies for us are **The Value Companies** - the companies that have a stable source on income.
