## How to use Financial Analysis?

To use financial analysis you will need:

- Financial Reports;
- Some kind of spreadsheet software - ideally Excel, but LibreOffice Calc, OnlyOffice and others are sufficient enough.

Basically that's it.

### Hot to find financial reports?

They are usually available on the site of the company in the segment called "For Investors". If you are analyzing a Russina company it is better to use RAS (Russian Accounting Standards) instead of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards).

**Lifehack:** Use DeepSeek or any other LLM that has OCR functions to convert report into table for Excel.
